# Untitled_Physics_Simulator

I threw bevy and bevy_rapier3d into a python package using maturin, mostly for fun

To try it out, make a new python environment and run "pip install maturin polars[all] patchelf"

Then you should be able to run "maturin develop" with that environment to build and install the package. add the "-r" flag to build release

There is an included test python file to see what's available

you'll need to supply your own .obj files for now

This is basically brand new and I have just hacked it together, so no judgement please. It is fun though!
